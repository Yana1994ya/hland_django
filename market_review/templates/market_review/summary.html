        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Although there are many applications in the current store that deal with hiking
            (or other outdoors activities that benefit from a map and modern device GPS functionality),
            those applications focus primarily on just sports and not tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, applications that do focus on tourism, such as Tripadvisor, usually
            only target urban, rather than nature, tourism. Tripadvisor, for example, can suggest you
            visit a certain park, but once you're there, it won't suggest what you should do there,
            what places are worth visiting inside, where can you see nice views in that park.
        </p>
        <p>
            An application that combines both, moderated content from commercial tourism. As well as user content
            (such as worthwhile tails, pictures and reviews), as well as a powerful parameterized
            search &amp; recommendation engine, will be able to attract younger tourists that like
            outdoor activities as well as the occasional urban attraction.
        </p>
        <h3>Monetization</h3>
        <p>
            For our application to be sustainable, a monetization model is required to support
            maintenance, future development and the infrastructure(backend servers). I suggest
            trying to monetize from businesses that want to appear(or be somehow highlighted) on the
            map of attractions in the application. In my opinion this model can be the best
            compromise between good user experience and sustainability.
        </p>
