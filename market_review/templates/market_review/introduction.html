<h1 class="pt-1">Hollyday Land - Market review.</h1>
<h2>Introduction.</h2>
<p>
    Although there are many applications that are built around hiking and vacationing, usually those
    applications aren't
    trying to combine the two into a single useful package, also, those applications usually donâ€™t
    have any
    timed events
    support (those are covered by a third category in which you specifically buy tickets).
</p>
<p>
    Our application will attempt to combine the 3 different use cases into a single map so the user
    gets all
    this
    information in a glance instead of having to switch Apps.
